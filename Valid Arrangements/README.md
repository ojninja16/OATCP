1. The Code uses unordered maps to store adjacency lists, in-degrees, and out-degrees of each vertex.

2. The `buildGraph` function constructs the graph from the given pairs of vertices. It iterates through each pair and updates the adjacency lists and degrees accordingly.

3. The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search traversal of the graph starting from a given node.It recursively explores adjacent nodes and marks them as visited, appending them to the `order` vector.

4. The `validArrangement` function determines whether a valid arrangement of pairs exists.It identifies the starting node for DFS traversal by finding the node with out-degree > in-degree.Then, it performs DFS traversal from this node to obtain the topological order of vertices.
