1. Initialize `sum` to 0 and `cnt` to 0 (representing the number of patches required).
2. Iterate through the range `[0, n]` using a loop.
3. Inside the loop, check if the current element `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `sum + 1`.
   - If it is, add `nums[i]` to `sum` and increment `i`.
   - If not, increment `cnt` by 1 and add `sum + 1` to `sum`.
4. Repeat step 3 until `sum` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
5. Return `cnt` as the minimum number of patches required.
