1. A stack `st` is used to maintain the monotonic sequence of digits.
1. The program iterates over the digits in `s` and performs the following steps:
  - While the stack is not empty, `k` is greater than 0, and the top of the stack is greater than the current digit, pop the top element from the stack and decrement `k`.
  - Push the current digit onto the stack.
3. After iterating over all digits, if `k` is still greater than 0, pop `k` elements from the top of the stack.
4. Pop all remaining elements from the stack and construct the answer string `ans` in reverse order.
5. Reverse the `ans` string.
6. Remove any leading zeroes from `ans` and store the result in `fans`.
7. If `fans` is an empty string, print "0"; otherwise, print `fans`.
