1. Iterate through each bit position from 0 to 31 (32 bits in an integer).
2. For each bit position, count the number of set bits across all elements in the input array.
3. Calculate the count of unset bits for the current bit position by subtracting the count of set bits from the total number of elements.
4. For each bit position, calculate the contribution to the total Hamming distance by multiplying the count of set bits by the count of unset bits.
5. Sum the contributions from all bit positions to obtain the total Hamming distance.
