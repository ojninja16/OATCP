1. The code defines a function `generateSubsequences` to generate all subsequences of a given string up to length 4.

2. It maintains a set `uniqueSubsequences` to store unique subsequences encountered while generating subsequences for each string.

3. The code stores the generated subsequences for each input string in a vector of vectors `allSubsequences`.

4. It iterates through `allSubsequences` and writes each subsequence to the output file, ensuring uniqueness across all strings.
