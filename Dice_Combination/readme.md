## Naive Recursive Approach (Basic, Inefficient)
A basic approach to this problem would be to try all possible sums obtainable by throwing the dice once and then recursively calculate the remaining ways to get the remaining sum (n - dice_throw) using the remaining throws (n - 1).

## Breakdown:

### Base Case: If the sum (n) is 0, there's only 1 way to get it (throwing nothing), so we return 1.
Recursive Case:
Iterate over all possible dice throw values (j) from 1 to 6.
If the remaining sum (n - j) is non-negative, recursively call the function to calculate the number of ways to get the remaining sum (n - j) using the remaining throws (n - 1).
Add the number of ways returned by the recursive calls for each possible dice throw value (j) to get the total number of ways to construct the sum (n).
### Complexity Analysis (Naive Recursive Approach):

Time Complexity: Exponential due to redundant calculations of subproblems.
Space Complexity: O(depth of recursion) - proportional to the number of function calls on the stack.
Note: This approach is shown for understanding the problem but is not recommended due to its inefficiency.

Dynamic Programming Approach (Better, Efficient)
The provided code utilizes dynamic programming for an efficient solution. Dynamic programming solves subproblems and stores the results to avoid redundant calculations.

### Steps:

Initialization:
Create a table dp of size (n + 1) to store the number of ways to get each sum from 0 to n.
Initialize dp[0] to 1 (there's 1 way to get a sum of 0 - by throwing nothing).
Iterate through possible sums:
Iterate over all possible sums (i) from 1 to n.
Iterate through dice throws:
For each sum (i), iterate over all possible dice throws (j) from 1 to 6.
Update the table:
If the remaining sum (i - j) is non-negative, the number of ways to get the sum (i) is the sum of the number of ways to get the remaining sum (i - j) and the number of ways to get the current dice throw (j) (which is always 1).
Update the table dp[i] with this value.
Base Case:

The base case (dp[0] = 1) is handled during initialization.
